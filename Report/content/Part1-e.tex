\subsection{E. Extending Batch Size with Tiling (8 marks)}\label{sec:1e}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After tiling, the latency comes to 458106 cycles for 2048 batches, i.e., the latency per input is 223.7 cycles, which is almost the same as that in \autoref{sec:1d}.
Without performance loss, the BRAM usage is reduced from 60\% to 36\%.
