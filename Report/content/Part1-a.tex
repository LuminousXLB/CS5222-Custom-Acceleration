For Vitis 2020.2, the command used should be
\begin{minted}{console}
    $ vitis_hls -f hls.tcl
\end{minted}
The report generated by HLS (as in \autoref{tab:float-loop-1a-baseline-autopipe}) shows that some pipelining has already been done automatically by Vitis HLS.
After inspecting the migration guide, I added two lines in the \texttt{hls.tcl}:
\begin{minted}{tcl}
    config_compile -pipeline_loops 0
    set_clock_uncertainty 12.5%
\end{minted}

The performance and utilization estimates of the two profiles, together with those for the following profiles, are reported in \autoref{tab:float-summary}.
The new loop details is as \autoref{tab:float-loop-1a-baseline-nopipe}.
It turns out that the overall performance is a little bit worse than documented.
This is because every iteration in L3 loop takes 11 cycles and thus
2816 cycles in total to perform a single inner product.
