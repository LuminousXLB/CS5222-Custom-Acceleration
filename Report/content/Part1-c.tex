\subsection{Increasing Pipeline Parallelism by Repartitioning Memories (8 marks)}\label{sec:1c}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The work in this section is based on L2 pipelining with auto pipelining enabled using T2P memory.
The loop details for this baseline is in \autoref{tab:float-loop-1c0-baseline-ap-l2}.

\subsubsection{Understanding the \texttt{dim} parameter}\label{sec:1cDim}

Instead of diving into the \texttt{factor}, which is of interest in this project,
we try to choose an appropriate \texttt{dim}.
The \texttt{dim} option is used to specify which dimension is partitioned.
\autoref{fig:float-partition-dim} is a figure coming from \textit{Vitis HLS User Guide (ug1399)}, which clearly shows the idea of \texttt{dim}.
In our application, the loop body of L2 is pipelined, which reads 256 elements from \texttt{in\_buf} and 256 elements from \texttt{weight\_buf}.
In order to improve parallelism, it is obvious that we should distribute the one vector of 256 elements to several blocks of memory.
That is, we need to set \texttt{dim} to 2.

\end{figure}

I have also experimented on this, where the code is modified as \autoref{fig:1c1-partition-d12}.
The HLS summary (\autoref{tab:float-summary}) shows setting \texttt{dim} to 1, producing the same number of adders and multipliers, introduces more resource usage but the latency is worse.
On the contrary, setting \texttt{dim} to 2 leads to introducing more floating-point adders and multipliers and achieves a lower latency.
The result also supports our conclusion above.

\subsubsection{Trying different \texttt{factor}s}\label{sec:1cFac}

As shown in \autoref{tab:float-summary}, when \texttt{factor}=8, the latency is reduced to 4911, which means 46.4x improvement, where 16 floating-point adders and 16 floating-point multipliers are used.
When \texttt{factor}=16, the latency is reduced to 4279, which means 53.3x improvement, where 32 floating-point adders and 32 floating-point multipliers are used.
That is exactly 16 times of that when array partition is not used.
From \autoref{tab:float-loop-1c2-partition-ap-d2-f8} and \autoref{tab:float-loop-1c2-partition-ap-d2-f16}, it can be seen that the initiation interval is 16 cyles when \texttt{factor}=8 and 8 cycles when \texttt{factor}=16.
Adding the \texttt{factor} to 32 makes the utilization of DSP and LUT exceeds the resource budget.
